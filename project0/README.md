                                        Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
  This is my first experience creating a web page. Only 2 lectures viewed on the EDX portal and you can already do something similar.
To navigate the site, use the bar at the top of the page. On the music page you will find several songs that I like.
On the movies page there is a table with some of my favorite films. And a brief description of the plot of each of them.
On the contacts page there are several ways by which you can contact me. On the about page, there is my short biography and a few words about learning web development.
